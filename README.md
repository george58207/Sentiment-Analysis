This repo does not include datasets. Download `movie_data.csv` from https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/raw/master/ch08/movie_data.csv.gz and unzip it.
Generate `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` locally using the preprocessing steps in the code, then run the experiments by uncommenting the relevant code in main.
